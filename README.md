# PHP: Division by Zero Error in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: division by zero when calculating the average of an array of numbers.  The `bug.php` file shows the flawed function, while `bugSolution.php` presents a corrected version with proper error handling.

The issue arises when the input array is empty.  The solution addresses this by checking for an empty array before performing the division.
